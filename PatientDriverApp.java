/*
 * Class: CMSC203 
 * Instructor: Dr. Ahmed Tarek
 * Description: Create a program that intakes a patient's information in one class. Then that patient's procedureâ€™s information in another class. Then displaying a report that contains the patients information and the list of procedures along with the corresponding information. Then displaying the total cost of all the procedures combined. Then displaying information about the programmer and the assignment.
 * Due: 02/24/2025
 * Platform/compiler: Eclipse
 * I pledge that I have completed the programming assignment 
 * independently. I have not copied the code from a student or any source. I have not given my code to any student.
 * Print your Name here: Steven Shiblie
